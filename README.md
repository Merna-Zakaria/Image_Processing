# image-processing
This project aims to give you a real-world scenario in which you would read and write to your disk via a Node.js express server rather than a database.

this project build an API that can be used in two different ways.
- As a simple placeholder API, the first allows you to place images into your frontend with the size set via URL parameters.
* The second use case is as a library to serve properly scaled versions of your images to the front end to reduce page load size. Rather than needing to resize and upload multiple copies of the same image to be used throughout your site, the API will handle resizing and serving stored images for you.
